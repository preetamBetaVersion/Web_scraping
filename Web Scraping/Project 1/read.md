### Implementing Web Scraping in Python with BeautifulSoup
<br>
There are mainly two ways to extract data from a website:

    Use the API of the website (if it exists). For example, Facebook has the Facebook Graph API which allows retrieval of data posted on Facebook.
    Access the HTML of the webpage and extract useful information/data from it. This technique is called web scraping or web harvesting or web data extraction.

**Note** : To run the main.py file, go to the terminal and run the command `python main.py`
